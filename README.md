# Source of the data stored in `example_data`:
This repository makes use of 43 GHz VLBA data from the VLBA-BU Blazar Monitoring Program (VLBA-BU-BLAZAR;
http://www.bu.edu/blazars/VLBAproject.html), funded by NASA through the Fermi Guest Investigator Program. The VLBA is an instrument of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated by Associated Universities, Inc.

The data stored to be used as an example is taken from https://www.bu.edu/blazars/VLBA_GLAST/0316.html (epoch 2010-11-01 of 3C84). `.fits` files are produced in difmap using the BU BLAZAR Programs data.
